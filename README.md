# Retail Sales Analysis — Mini Data Project  

## Project Overview  
This project analyzes sales data from a retail company to identify patterns, trends, and opportunities for business improvement.  
It simulates a real-world business scenario where a Data Analyst must explore, visualize, and interpret key sales indicators to support decision-making.

## Objectives  
- Understand the behavior of product sales by category and region.  
- Identify sales trends over time.  
- Detect seasonal patterns and product performance differences.  
- Provide actionable recommendations to optimize sales and inventory management.

## Tools & Technologies Used  
- **Python**: data processing and analysis.  
- **Pandas**: data manipulation and cleaning.  
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**: data visualization.  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: development environment.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 1. Sales by Product Category  
Visualized total sales per product category to identify which products drive the most revenue.  
 Electronics and Clothing were the top-performing categories.

### 2. Sales Over Time  
Analyzed monthly sales trends and identified seasonal peaks during promotional periods (November–December).  
 Sales increase significantly during end-of-year holidays.

### 3. Regional Performance  
Compared total sales between different store regions.  
 Some regions consistently outperform others, suggesting local marketing success or higher demand.

### 4. Price vs Quantity Sold  
Explored the relationship between average price and sales volume.  
 Lower-priced products sell more units, but mid-range products yield higher profit margins.

## Key Visualizations  
- **Bar chart**: Total sales per category.  
- **Line chart**: Monthly sales trends.  
- **Heatmap**: Regional sales performance.  
- **Scatter plot**: Price vs units sold.  

Each visualization helped to identify key business insights and potential optimization areas.

## Conclusions  

1. Electronics and Clothing are the top-performing categories.  
2. Sales display strong seasonal behavior, peaking during promotional months.  
3. Certain regions show consistent overperformance that can serve as benchmarks.  
4. Lower-priced items sell faster but may not generate maximum profit.

---

## Recommendations  

1. **Optimize inventory and promotions** before high-demand periods to maximize revenue.  
2. **Analyze best-performing regions** to replicate their strategies elsewhere.  
3. **Review product pricing** to improve margins on high-volume items.  
4. **Create category-based marketing campaigns** aligned with sales seasonality.
